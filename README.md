This web application takes an image of a music festival lineup and returns a table of all the artists along with their genres and top 3 songs. It also allows you to log into your spotify account and create a playlist with music from all of the artists in the festival.


To run the website on your local host, from the base directory:

Make a virtual environment with all requirements:

python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run app.py from the base directory:

python website/app.py


This was good practice of the Flask framework, API calling, and full stack web development.
